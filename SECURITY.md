## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to me privately. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**

Please send an email to **timothy.j.genz@gmail.com** with "Security Vulnerability Report" in the subject line.

In your report, please include:

- **A clear description** of the vulnerability.
- **The repository and file(s)** affected.
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability, including any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or videos.
- **The potential impact** of the vulnerability.

### What to Expect

- I will do my best to acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.
- You will receive an update on the status of the vulnerability within **7 days**.
- I will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed. I am happy to credit you for the discovery, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

I kindly ask that you follow the principles of responsible disclosure and not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been released. Thank you for helping to keep my projects secure!
