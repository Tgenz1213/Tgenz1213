### About Me

Call me Tim! As a former Marine transitioning into software engineering, my time in the military taught me to thrive in high-pressure environments, meticulously plan complex operations, and lead with a mission-first mindset. I now apply that same discipline and problem-solving focus to building robust and efficient software.

My favorite technology I've learned recently is Vue. Check out [my website](https://tgenz1213.me) to see it in action!

### What I'm working on

I'm currently enhancing my portfolio with two key full-stack features:

**1. Secure Contact Form:** I'm building a system where visitors can request contact, and a serverless backend will automatically email them my resume. This includes features like rate-limiting and other measures to prevent Denial of Wallet attacks.

**2. Dynamic Content with a CMS & Firebase:** I'm decoupling my site's content from the code to make it instantly updatable without redeploying. This dramatically improves maintainability.

> **Before:** Updating content required editing code, committing to Git, and running a full deployment pipeline.
>
> **After:** Updates will be as simple as editing text in a database and clicking "Save" for instant changes on the live site.
